# Social-Distancing
Project 1
## Game Play:
 
- This game is going to be similar (but not exactly like) Pac Man.  
- The player is in a room with one coronavirus sprite and other NPC characters.  
- The player must collect face masks around the room while avoiding touching the virus sprite.
- If the virus makes contact with any of the other NPC characters, they turn into viruses.
- The game ends if either of the following 2 conditions are met:
    - If the player collects all of the face masks without touching a virus, the player wins
    - If the player touches a virus before collecting all of the masks, the player loses.


## MVP

- [ ]A box (the player) will travel around a room attempting to make contact with small boxes(masks)
- [ ]Another different colored box (the virus) will randomly travel around the room, and the player must avoid contact with it.
- [ ]A third colored box (NPC) will randomly travel the room, and if it touches the virus, it will turn into another virus that the player also has to avoid.
- [ ]The player must make contact with all "mask" boxes without making contact with any "virus" boxes.  This will initiate the win function.
- [ ]If the player makes contact with any of the "virus" boxes, the game is over and the player loses


## Stretch Goals
- [ ]A menu before the game starts that givers player instructions and has a "Start Game" button
- [ ]Each different category of box (player, face masks, virus, other NPC characters) will be represented by a different sprite instead of a box.
- [ ]Any sprite that the virus bumps into will turn into the virus sprite.
- [ ]A scoreboard in the corner will increase with every face mask that the player collects
- [ ]Multiple levels with increasing difficulty (game starts with more viruses, virus will follow player instead of randomly traveling, etc.)
- [ ]Add music and sound effects
