# SOCIAL DISTANCING PITCH

## Game Play:
 
- This game is going to be similar (but not exactly like) Pac Man.  
- The player is in a room with one coronavirus sprite and other NPC characters.  
- The player must collect face masks around the room while avoiding touching the virus sprite.
- If the virus makes contact with any of the other NPC characters, they turn into viruses.
- The game ends if either of the following 2 conditions are met:
    - If the player collects all of the face masks without touching a virus, the player wins.
    - If the player touches a virus before collecting all of the masks, the player loses.




## MVP

- [ ]The player controls a box that travels around a room attempting to make contact with small boxes(masks).
- [ ]Different colored boxes (viruses) will travel both up and down and left and right across the room, and the player must avoid contact with them.
- [ ]The player must make contact with all "mask" boxes without making contact with any "virus" boxes.  This will initiate the win function.
- [ ]If the player makes contact with any of the "virus" boxes, the game is over and the player loses.


## Stretch Goals

- [ ]A third colored box (NPC) will travel in a similar pattern to the viruses, but starting in a different location. If these boxes touch the virus, it will turn into another virus that the player also has to avoid.
- [ ]Each different category of box (player, face mask virus, other NPC characters) will be represented by a different sprite instead of a box.
- [ ]Instead of moving back and forth, the viruses and NPC boxes will move randomly.
- [ ]A menu before the game starts that gives player instructions and has a "Start Game" button.
- [ ]A scoreboard in the corner will increase with every face mask that the player collects.
- [ ]Multiple levels with increasing difficulty (game starts with more viruses, virus will follow player instead of randomly traveling, etc.).
- [ ]Obsticles will be placed around the room that the player cannot cross.
- [ ]Add music and sound effects.
